Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are developing at a rapid pace, and touching our lives in unimagined ways. On one hand, AI is enhancing several day-to-day functions and improving productivity. On the other hand, there are fears that it may lead to redundancy and replacement of humans at work. As AI expands in scope and gets deployed on an increasingly wider scale, the question on everyoneâ€™s lips is: What will human intelligence look like in the future?

While it is true that AI will reinvent traditional methods of working and automate certain tasks, it will also create many new jobs that require new skills. According to a report, the skills needed for most jobs by 2030 will have changed by 65 percent compared to 2015 owing to the integration of digital technologies, including AI. More importantly, these skills will not just include technical skills but also human capabilities such as problem solving, critical thinking, innovation, and time management. People will neither be swept aside by AI transformation, nor will they passively watch it evolve. Instead, human intelligence will be an integral part of the AI journey, and crucial to its success
